How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Line by line comparison and also looking at previous version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Confidently code/make changes in system.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Autocommits may be incomplete/non-revertable state

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    While coding, dependency between files are common.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log gives all commits and Git diff allows to compare 2 commits/versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    As there is always a way to revert back to previous working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All my codings going forward
